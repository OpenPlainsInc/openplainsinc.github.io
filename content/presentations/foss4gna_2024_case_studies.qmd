## Whose using GRASS

### Civil and Environmental

- Researchers
- Modelers
- Data Engineers

## Features

- Lidar
- Hydrologly
- Map Calculations
- Geomorphology
- Remote Sensing
- Machine Learning

## GRASS as a Geoprocessing Engine

- GRASS is a geoprocessing engine
- Not your papi's GIS

## GRASS in the Wild

- Desktop
- HPC
- Cloud

## GRASS - sooo fast you usally don't need scale

## Geoprocessing on the Cloud

- Actinia REST API

## Case Study: Mudialis

### Free Data With Free Software

- GRASS GIS
- GRASS GIS Addons
- Actinia
