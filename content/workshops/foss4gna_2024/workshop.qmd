Welcome to the **Developing Web Applications with GRASS GIS workshop**! During this workshop you will learn how to create geospatial web applications using GRASS GIS, Actinia, and OpenPlains. 

- During the workshop we will learn how to develop web application using GRASS GIS.

## Overview

* [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) - is a raster and vector based geospatial processing engine.
* [Actinia](https://actinia-org.github.io/actinia-core/) - is the GRASS GIS REST API for scalable, distributed, high performance geospatial processing.

[Part 1. GRASS GIS 101](intro_grass.ipynb) Learn the basics of using GRASS GIS within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

- https://colab.research.google.com/github/OpenPlainsInc/openplainsinc.github.io/blob/main/content/workshops/foss4gna_2024/intro_grass.ipynb

[Part 2. Introduction to Actinia](intro_actinia.ipynb) Learn how to use actinia REST API.

[Part 3. Process Chains](process_chains.ipynb) Learn how to turn your GRASS GIS process into an actinia process chain.
