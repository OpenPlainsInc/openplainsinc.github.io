Welcome to the **Developing Web Applications with GRASS GIS workshop**! During this workshop you will learn how to create geospatial web applications using GRASS GIS, Actinia, and OpenPlains. 

- During the workshop we will learn how to develop web application using OpenPlains.

## Overview

* [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) - is a raster and vector based geospatial processing engine.
* [Actinia](https://actinia-org.github.io/actinia-core/) - is the GRASS GIS REST API for scalable, distributed, high performance geospatial processing.
<!-- * [OpenPlains: Grasslands]() - is an interactive geospatial modeling framework. -->
